					<p>In mathematics, a <strong>confidential conjugate</strong> is a variable that represents a mystery value, where its value only reveals itself at the end of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> process to allow the equation to be true or problem to be correct. While its value usually manifests itself as a negation, it could truly possess any value. In some rare cases, the confidential conjugate has been known to reveal itself as a function or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression">algebraic expression</a>, but it is imperative to remember that whatever is revealed has been its value throughout the entire arithmetic process and should not be questioned. The confidential conjugate has also been known to reveal itself as being equivalent to the difference between you and the person sitting next to you's answer during exams.</p>
                    <p>The confidential conjugate stems from concepts derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, and examples of it have been used in fundamental thought experiments such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Schrödinger's cat</a>. In Schrödinger's experiment, the unobserved state of the cat represents the confidential conjugate, only revealing its state when observed and the experiment is over.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The confidential conjugate was invented by Nathan Brewer while attending calculus classes at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cambridge_School_of_Weston">Cambridge School of Weston</a>. He discovered that often after completing a problem his answer would vary from the true answer by an unknown negative or factor. Since it is widely known that his math is impeccable, he theorized that there must be some outside and consistently changing factor that is causing a discrepancy in his arithmetic process. His work was revolutionary throughout the institution, and he was subsequently awarded the title of <em>graduation speaker</em>.</p>

					<h2>Uses</h2>
                    <p>When evaluating problems involving the real-life application of math and physics, it is imperative to add a confidential conjugate to ensure that the answer remains correct despite real-world uncertainty. By adding a confidential conjugate, you ensure that your answer is completely free from all uncertainty and error, allowing you to always receive the correct answer. </p>
